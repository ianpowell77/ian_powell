    <h2>Childhood</h2>
    <p>I was born on August 17, 1997 in Suffield, Ohio. I lived there until I moved in second grade. My family moved to a bigger city named, "Akron," and I lived there until 4th grade. In between the summer of 4th and 5th grade, my father's work transferred him to a station in Charlotte, North Carolina. I've lived here ever since.</p>

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>Most of my hobbies include either music or video games. I use to play a game called "League of Legends" very competetively. I played in tournaments and was ranked among the top 1% of players. I also use to play in a band called "Never I." I left because I wanted to pursue a more consistent career and had recently discovered my fiance was pregnant. I played in that band since I was 17 years old, and they are still together currently. They just played the Vans Warped Tour and continue to tour and make music.</p>

    <h2>Life Goals</h2>
    <p>All my life I've had very simple goals. I want a wife. I want a family. I want to be financially stable.</p>
